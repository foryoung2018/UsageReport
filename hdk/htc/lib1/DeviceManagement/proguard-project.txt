## Gson SERIALIZER SETTINGS
# See https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/source/browse/trunk/examples/android-proguard-example/proguard.cfg
# Gson uses generic type information stored in a class file when working with fields. Proguard
# removes such information by default, so configure it to keep all of it.
-keepattributes Signature

# Needed by google-api-client to keep generic types and @Key annotations accessed via reflection
-keepattributes Signature,RuntimeVisibleAnnotations,AnnotationDefault
-keepclassmembers class * {
  @com.google.api.client.util.Key <fields>;
}

# Ignore SLF4J optional implementations
